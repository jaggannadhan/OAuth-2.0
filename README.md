# OAuth-2.0
This project demonstrates how OAuth works with various providers: Google, Facebook, GitHub, and Salesforce.

## What is OAuth?
OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used to grant websites or applications access to user information without exposing passwords.

## How it Works
1. The user clicks the "Login with Google" button on the frontend.
2. The backend redirects the user to Google's OAuth consent screen.
3. After granting permission, Google redirects the user back to the application with an authorization code.
4. The backend exchanges the authorization code for an access token and retrieves the user's profile information.
